# Hotel Booking Cancellation Study

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
This is the final project for INFO-557. The purpose of this project is to use hotel booking data to find the best estimator to predict poetential cancellation made by customers, which will allow the hotel to reduce cancelation and maximize profits in the future.

## Project Description
The orginal data source is from Hotel booking demand datasets [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.11.126]. The data is also avaible on Kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand]. This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. The data was downloaded and cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020.\n
I did some analysis starting from explotary data analysis, visualization, and then features engineering, and finally implmenting machine learning models to better predict the cancelations.
